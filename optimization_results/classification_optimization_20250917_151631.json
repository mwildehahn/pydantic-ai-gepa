    "instructions": "Task: Assign the overall sentiment of the given text as exactly one of: positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nOutput format: Return only a JSON object of the form {\"category\":\"positive\"} or {\"category\":\"negative\"} or {\"category\":\"neutral\"}. Do not include any other text.\n\nDecision rules\n- Neutral default for factual/no-cue statements: If the text lacks clear evaluative or affective cues, classify as neutral. Examples of cues: evaluative adjectives/adverbs (amazing, terrible), affective verbs (love, hate), polarity shifters (unfortunately, thankfully), emojis/emoticons (\ud83d\ude0a, :( ), exclamation or emphatic punctuation.\n- Idioms and pragmatic tone (idiom-aware handling): Some fixed expressions carry typical sentiment even without overtly polar words. Treat these by common usage:\n  - \"it is what it is\" \u2192 negative (resignation)\n  - \"what\u2019s done is done\" \u2192 negative (resignation)\n  - \"could be worse\" \u2192 negative (mild dissatisfaction)\n  - \"not bad\", \"no complaints\" \u2192 mildly positive unless contradicted by nearby negatives\n- Negation and shifters: Handle polarity flips correctly.\n  - \"not good\" \u2192 negative; \"not terrible\" \u2192 mildly positive/neutral; \"unfortunately\" \u2192 negative; \"thankfully\" \u2192 positive.\n- Mixed sentiment (both positive and negative present): Choose the overall valence using these tie-breakers:\n  1) Core vs. secondary attributes: In product/service reviews, negatives about core attributes (e.g., quality, reliability, functionality, safety, service experience) outweigh positives about secondary attributes (e.g., price, packaging, shipping speed, aesthetics).\n  2) Contrastive structure: After contrastive markers (but, though, although, however), the latter clause usually reflects the overall judgment.\n  3) Intensity: Stronger sentiment (e.g., \"awful\" vs. \"nice\") dominates.\n  If still truly balanced with no dominance, lean neutral.\n- Punctuation/emphasis: Exclamation marks and intensifiers amplify sentiment strength; repeated punctuation/emojis increase intensity.\n- Do not infer sentiment without cues: Avoid reading optimism/pessimism into generic words or plain event statements.\n\nFew-shot guidance (input \u2192 output)\n- \"Things happened\" \u2192 {\"category\":\"neutral\"}\n- \"It is what it is\" \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \"Great price, mediocre quality\" \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \"Mediocre price, great quality\" \u2192 {\"category\":\"positive\"}\n- \"Not bad\" \u2192 {\"category\":\"positive\"}\n- \"Unfortunately, we missed the bus\" \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \"We delivered the report on time.\" \u2192 {\"category\":\"neutral\"}\n- \"Love the battery life, hate the camera\" \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \"Amazing service!\" \u2192 {\"category\":\"positive\"}",
