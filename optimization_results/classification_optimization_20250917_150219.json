    "instructions": "Task: Classify the overall sentiment of the given text.\n\nOutput format (strict): {\"category\":\"positive\"|\"negative\"|\"neutral\"}\nReturn only this JSON object.\n\nDecision rules\n- Categories:\n  - positive: overall favorable attitude.\n  - negative: overall unfavorable attitude.\n  - neutral: no clear evaluative language or genuinely unclear/ambivalent sentiment.\n- Mixed content: Do NOT output \"mixed\". Choose the dominant overall sentiment using these tie-breakers:\n  1) Aspect weighting: Prioritize sentiment about core attributes over secondary ones.\n     \u2022 Products: quality, performance, reliability, durability > price, shipping, packaging.\n     \u2022 Restaurants/services: core deliverable (e.g., food taste/quality) > service speed/ambience.\n  2) Polarity priority: A clearly negative evaluative term about a core attribute (e.g., poor, bad, terrible, mediocre, flimsy) makes the overall sentiment negative even if a secondary positive is present.\n  3) Contrastive conjunctions (but/however/though): The clause after the contrast usually carries more weight; override only if aspect weighting indicates the other clause covers the core attribute.\n- Negation: Invert polarity with not/no/never (e.g., \"not good\" \u21d2 negative).\n- Intensifiers/diminishers: Modify strength, not polarity (e.g., \"a bit slow\" is still negative; \"absolutely amazing\" is positive, stronger).\n- Implicit and idiomatic sentiment cues:\n  \u2022 Resignation/coping set phrases usually signal mild negativity: \"it is what it is\", \"oh well\", \"can\u2019t be helped\", \"that\u2019s life\", \"so it goes\", \"could be worse\" \u21d2 negative (low intensity) unless clearly used in a meta/analytic/philosophical explanation.\n  \u2022 Dismissive/minimizing markers: \"meh\", \"whatever\", \"so-so\", \"fine, I guess\" \u21d2 negative (low intensity).\n  \u2022 Litotes that imply mild positivity: \"not bad\", \"can\u2019t complain\" \u21d2 positive (low intensity) unless contradicted by explicit negatives or clear sarcasm.\n- Neutrality threshold: Reserve \"neutral\" for informational/definitional statements with no evaluative or affective stance (e.g., \"Things happened\", \"Price and quality vary\"). Stock coping expressions are not neutral in typical conversational use.\n\nFew-shot examples\n- \"Great price, mediocre quality\" -> {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \"The food was absolutely incredible but the service was a bit slow\" -> {\"category\":\"positive\"}\n- \"Things happened\" -> {\"category\":\"neutral\"}\n- \"Cheap but terrible sound.\" -> {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \"Affordable, but the build feels flimsy.\" -> {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \"Price and quality vary\" -> {\"category\":\"neutral\"}\n- \"It is what it is\" -> {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \"Oh well.\" -> {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \"Not bad at all\" -> {\"category\":\"positive\"}\n- \"Can\u2019t complain\" -> {\"category\":\"positive\"}",
