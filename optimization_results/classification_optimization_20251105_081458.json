    "instructions": "Task: Given <text>, assign the overall sentiment as exactly one of: positive, negative, or neutral.\n\nOutput format: Return only a JSON object of the form {\"category\":\"positive\"} or {\"category\":\"negative\"} or {\"category\":\"neutral\"}. Do not include any other text.\n\nGeneral approach\n- Extract sentiment-bearing cues and their targets (aspects): evaluative adjectives/adverbs (great, awful, mediocre), affective verbs (love, hate), polarity shifters (unfortunately, thankfully), negations, emojis/emoticons, emphasis (ALL CAPS, !!!), and idioms/pragmatic tone.\n- Be idiom- and pragmatics-aware: some expressions convey sentiment without overt polarity words (resignation, consolation, faint praise, hedged criticism).\n- When multiple aspects are mentioned, identify which are core vs. secondary and weight by both centrality and intensity.\n- If no clear affective cues remain after analysis, default to neutral.\n\nDecision rules\n1) Neutral default for affect-free statements\n- Plain descriptions/events/statements of fact with no evaluative tone \u2192 neutral.\n- Novelty/difference without evaluation (e.g., \u201cThat\u2019s different\u201d) \u2192 neutral unless paired with clear positive/negative cues.\n\n2) Negation and shifters\n- \u201cnot good\u201d, \u201cnot great\u201d \u2192 negative.\n- \u201cnot bad\u201d, \u201cnot terrible\u201d \u2192 neutral by default; upgrade to positive only with additional clear praise.\n- Discourse markers: \u201cunfortunately\u201d \u2192 negative; \u201cthankfully\u201d \u2192 positive.\n\n3) Hedged/softened criticism and unmet expectations (treat as negative by default)\n- Modal + comparative indicating unrealized improvement: \u201ccould/should (have been) better,\u201d \u201cwould be better,\u201d \u201ccould be much better.\u201d\n- Soft critique formulas: \u201cneeds work,\u201d \u201cneeds improvement,\u201d \u201croom for improvement,\u201d \u201cnot ideal,\u201d \u201cfalls short,\u201d \u201cleft a lot to be desired.\u201d\n- Do NOT misread the word \u201cbetter\u201d as positive when it signals a shortfall relative to a standard.\n\n4) Concessive vs. contrastive structures\n- Concessive mitigation (e.g., \u201cbut at least\u201d, \u201con the bright side\u201d, \u201cstill\u201d) usually offers consolation after a negative. Do NOT let weak consolation flip a strong prior negative.\n  Example: \u201cThe service was terrible but at least the food was edible\u201d \u2192 negative.\n- Standard contrast (\u201cbut\u201d, \u201chowever\u201d, \u201cthough\u201d): the latter clause may determine overall sentiment only if it is at least as strong and as central/relevant as what precedes it. Otherwise, prioritize the stronger/more central sentiment.\n\n5) Faint praise / minimal-standard terms\n- Words like \u201cokay/ok\u201d, \u201cfine\u201d, \u201cdecent\u201d, \u201cpassable\u201d, \u201cserviceable\u201d, \u201cedible\u201d \u2192 neutral to very weak positive.\n- \u201cmediocre\u201d, \u201cso-so\u201d, \u201csubpar\u201d \u2192 negative by default (do not treat \u201cmediocre\u201d as neutral or positive).\n- These weak terms do not override strong negatives on core issues.\n\n6) Mixed sentiment resolution (centrality and intensity)\n- Core vs. secondary attributes (typical priority in product/service contexts): quality/performance/reliability/safety/overall experience > functionality/usability > customer service > timeliness/speed > price/value > packaging/shipping/appearance.\n  \u2022 \u201cGreat price, mediocre quality\u201d \u2192 negative (core quality outweighs price; \u201cmediocre\u201d is a negative cue).\n  \u2022 \u201cShipping was slow, but the product quality is outstanding\u201d \u2192 positive (core quality outweighs shipping speed).\n- Intensity matters: stronger sentiment (\u201cawful\u201d, \u201camazing\u201d, repeated !!!, ALL CAPS, strongly valenced emojis) dominates weaker sentiment (\u201cnice\u201d, \u201ca bit slow\u201d).\n- Do not blindly favor the last clause; apply the contrast rules and weighting.\n- If still truly balanced with no dominance, label neutral.\n\n7) Emojis, punctuation, emphasis\n- Positive cues: \ud83d\ude0a, \ud83d\ude00, \u2764\ufe0f, \ud83d\udc4d, words like \u201clove\u201d, exclamation for praise.\n- Negative cues: \u2639\ufe0f, \ud83d\ude20, \ud83d\udc80, \ud83d\udc4e, words like \u201chate\u201d, complaint markers, repeated \u201c!\u201d for frustration.\n- Intensifiers (very, extremely), repetition, and ALL CAPS increase sentiment strength.\n\n8) Idioms and pragmatic tone (idiom-aware handling)\n- Resigned/defeatist expressions (treat as negative): \u201cit is what it is\u201d, \u201cwhat\u2019s done is done\u201d, \u201cso be it\u201d, \u201coh well\u201d, \u201cwhat can you do\u201d.\n- Consolation/benchmarking upward (treat as mildly positive unless clearly framed as complaint): \u201ccould be worse\u201d.\n- Absence-of-complaint formulas: \u201cno complaints\u201d, \u201ccan\u2019t complain\u201d \u2192 neutral by default; mildly positive only with additional positive cues.\n- Lukewarm/dismissive: \u201cmeh\u201d, \u201cwhatever\u201d \u2192 negative-leaning (typically negative).\n- Timeliness praise like \u201cPerfect timing\u201d \u2192 positive.\n\nFew-shot guidance (input \u2192 output)\n- \u201cThings happened\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"neutral\"}\n- \u201cThat\u2019s different\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"neutral\"}\n- \u201cIt is what it is\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \u201cIt could be worse\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"positive\"}\n- \u201cIt could be better\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \u201cNeeds work\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \u201cThere\u2019s room for improvement\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \u201cNot ideal\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \u201cGreat price, mediocre quality\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \u201cMediocre price, great quality\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"positive\"}\n- \u201cNot bad\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"neutral\"}\n- \u201cNot great\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \u201cUnfortunately, we missed the bus\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \u201cWe delivered the report on time.\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"neutral\"}\n- \u201cLove the battery life, hate the camera\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \u201cAmazing service!\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"positive\"}\n- \u201cThe service was terrible but at least the food was edible\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \u201cShipping was slow, but the product quality is outstanding\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"positive\"}\n- \u201cOkay, I guess\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"neutral\"}\n- \u201cmeh\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \u201cPerfect timing\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"positive\"}\n- \u201cIt was okay\u201d \u2192 {\"category\":\"neutral\"}",

Do not include any other text.\n\nDecision rules\n- Neutral default for factual/no-cue statements: If the text lacks clear evaluative or affective cues, classify as neutral. Examples of cues: evaluative adjectives/adverbs (amazing, terrible), affective verbs (love, hate), polarity shifters (unfortunately, thankfully), emojis/emoticons (\ud83d\ude0a, :( ), exclamation or emphatic punctuation.\n- Idioms and pragmatic tone (idiom-aware handling): Some fixed expressions carry typical sentiment even without overtly polar words. Treat these by common usage:\n  - \"it is what it is\" \u2192 negative (resignation)\n  - \"what\u2019s done is done\" \u2192 negative (resignation)\n  - \"could be worse\" \u2192 negative (mild dissatisfaction)\n  - \"not bad\", \"no complaints\" \u2192 mildly positive unless contradicted by nearby negatives\n- Negation and shifters: Handle polarity flips correctly.\n  - \"not good\" \u2192 negative; \"not terrible\" \u2192 mildly positive/neutral; \"unfortunately\" \u2192 negative; \"thankfully\" \u2192 positive.\n- Mixed sentiment (both positive and negative present): Choose the overall valence using these tie-breakers:\n  1) Core vs. secondary attributes: In product/service reviews, negatives about core attributes (e.g., quality, reliability, functionality, safety, service experience) outweigh positives about secondary attributes (e.g., price, packaging, shipping speed, aesthetics).\n  2) Contrastive structure: After contrastive markers (but, though, although, however), the latter clause usually reflects the overall judgment.\n  3) Intensity: Stronger sentiment (e.g., \"awful\" vs. \"nice\") dominates.\n  If still truly balanced with no dominance, lean neutral.\n- Punctuation/emphasis: Exclamation marks and intensifiers amplify sentiment strength; repeated punctuation/emojis increase intensity.\n- Do not infer sentiment without cues: Avoid reading optimism/pessimism into generic words or plain event statements.\n\nFew-shot guidance (input \u2192 output)\n- \"Things happened\" \u2192 {\"category\":\"neutral\"}\n- \"It is what it is\" \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \"Great price, mediocre quality\" \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \"Mediocre price, great quality\" \u2192 {\"category\":\"positive\"}\n- \"Not bad\" \u2192 {\"category\":\"positive\"}\n- \"Unfortunately, we missed the bus\" \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \"We delivered the report on time.\" \u2192 {\"category\":\"neutral\"}\n- \"Love the battery life, hate the camera\" \u2192 {\"category\":\"negative\"}\n- \"Amazing service!\" \u2192 {\"category\":\"positive\"}",
